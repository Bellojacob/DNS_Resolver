Project: DNS Resolver

Instructions:
    To run my project, you first will need to unzip/extract the zip file I have submitted. Then you will need to navigate (cd) to
    the project directory where you unzipped it using a command line interface. Once you are within the project directory, you 
    will need to run the main source file which is dns_resolver.py. To run this file, enter the command python (for windows) python3(mac)
    followed by the file name (dns_resolver.py), along with a query file, and a cache file. This is an example from my development:
    
    My directory path:                   My command within the command line:
    C:\Programming\cst_311\dns_resolver> python .\dns_resolver.py .\my-sample-query.txt .\cache-entries.txt  

    The output will be displayed within the terminal window you are using!

    File Structure:
    -dns_resolver.py
    -dns-queries.txt
    -cache-entries.txt
    -instructions.txt
    -servers
        -1-0-0-0.txt
        -1-0-0-1.txt
        -1-100-23-2.txt
        -etc



    External resources I used for this project include:
        -ChatGPT
            - line 9,22,38,62,78,101 - I was getting weird letters when reading and printing information from the texts files so I referred to ChatGPT
            about what these letters were, they were hexadecimal symbols and I used encoding="utf-8-sig" to remove them
            - line 25 - To remove the extra newline and use end='\n' instead
            - line 86 - To print an array/list without adding newlines and separating them by ;
            - lines 106-112 - To make sure the user has to enter 3 files through the command line, I have previously only ran python through IDE'same
            - line 5 - ChatGPT recommended that I use a queue data structure, and recommended I use deque
